# 02 Canonical IR Contract

## Purpose

Define the stable internal document model used after conversion and before cleanup.

## Flowchart Mapping

This stage supports the flowchart nodes for Canonical IR conversion, normalization, and structure indexing.

## Contract

Canonical IR must include:

- `CanonicalDocument`
- `SourceSnapshot`
- `TypedNode`
- `SourceSpan`
- `Asset`
- `Relationship`
- `AnnotationSet`
- `TransformationLedger`

The contract must preserve source order, source evidence, asset links, and node identity.

## Acceptance

- Every converted source can identify the route that produced its IR.
- Every cleanup target can point back to a source span when the converter provides one.
- Rendered Markdown can be regenerated from IR plus accepted changes.

## Risk And Rollback

Risk: an unstable IR contract can break conversion, cleanup, render, and feedback at the same time.

Rollback: keep the existing conversion artifacts active while new IR artifacts run in parallel until tests prove equivalence.
